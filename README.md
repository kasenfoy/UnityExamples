# Welcome!

This repo is a collection of C# Examples I find helpful when working on projects in Unity.

# Examples:
## EventHandler
The [EventHandler](EventHandlerExample.cs) example goes over how to create Events and Listeners/Subscribers in a very decoupled way.
This increases iteration speed and helps separate gameplay logic. Example use case: 
Class A doesn't need to be aware that Class B exists, but class B can listen to events fired by Class A.
